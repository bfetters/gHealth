# gHealth
This is the final project created during my Data Engineering course at GalvanizeU.

It is an Enterprise-Level "Big Data" System roughly based on existing health tracking applications like MyFitnessPal using scalable data engineering techniques for distributed systems including Avro, AWS S3, Spark, Kafka, and HBase. It is based on the [Lambda Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_architecture) which is intended to be able to handle massive quantities of data by leveraging both batch-processing and stream-processing methods.
