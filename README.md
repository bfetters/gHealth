# gHealth
This is the final project created during my Data Engineering course at GalvanizeU.

It is an Enterprise-Level "Big Data" System roughly based on existing health tracking applications like MyFitnessPal using scalable data engineering techniques for distributed systems including Avro, AWS S3, Spark, Kafka, and HBase.
