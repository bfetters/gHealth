# gHealth

### Overview
This is the final project created during my Data Engineering course at GalvanizeU.

It is a standalone Enterprise-Level "Big Data" System inspired by existing health tracking applications like MyFitnessPal using scalable data engineering techniques for distributed systems. It is based on the [Lambda Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_architecture) which is intended to be able to handle massive quantities of data by leveraging both batch-processing and stream-processing methods.
